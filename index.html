      <h3>Origins & Uniqueness</h3>
      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          Despite sharing a name with the giant panda, red pandas are not closely related — 
          but they do share a love for bamboo and even have a <span class="accent">false thumb</span> 
          to help them grip it! Their retractable claws and bushy tails help them climb trees 
          and stay balanced, while their tails also double as cozy blankets. As an 
          <span class="accent">umbrella species</span>, protecting them helps safeguard 
          entire mountain forest ecosystems.

      <h3>What Makes Them So Irresistible</h3>
      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          With faces like foxes and the posture of tiny acrobats, red pandas are endlessly 
          charming. They rest high in the trees during the day, playing and grooming 
          between naps. Their reddish “tear tracks” help protect their eyes from the sun, 
          and when threatened, they rise on their hind legs to appear larger — 
          though they usually end up looking even cuter.

      <h3>Their World</h3>
      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          Red pandas dwell in cool, temperate forests of the Himalayas and parts of China, 
          Nepal, and Myanmar. They love the quiet canopy life where moss, bamboo, and 
          fresh mountain air surround them. Sadly, habitat loss and fragmentation threaten 
          their survival — yet their resilience and playfulness inspire people everywhere 
          to care for the forests they call home.
