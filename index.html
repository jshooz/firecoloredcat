        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="images/rp-in-tree.jpg" alt="Red panda in the forest" class="section-img">
        <p>With their fox-like faces, ringed tails, and gentle curiosity, red pandas are some of the most delightful creatures in the animal kingdom. They move quietly among the misty Himalayan treetops, spending much of their day resting in trees and conserving energy, often curled up with their fluffy tails wrapped around themselves.</p>

        <h2>What Makes Them So Irresistible</h2>
        <img src="images/rp-mouth.jpg" alt="Adorable red panda close-up" class="section-img">
        <p>It’s hard not to smile when you see a red panda curled up, using its fluffy tail like a blanket. Their playful energy and curious nature make them appear both shy and mischievous. Their thick fur and rust-red color keep them warm and camouflaged in the trees.</p>

        <h2>Their Peaceful Personality</h2>
        <img src="images/sleeping-rp.jpg" alt="Red panda climbing a tree" class="section-img">
        <p>Red pandas live quiet, gentle lives, spending much of their time resting in trees, climbing gracefully, and playing among the branches. When threatened, they stand on their hind legs to appear larger—an adorable show of bravery that only makes them more endearing.</p>

        <h2>Fire-Colored Origins</h2>
        <img src="images/rp-in-snow.jpg" alt="Red panda exploring forest" class="section-img">
        <p>Their name, <em>Ailurus fulgens</em>, means “shining” or “fire-colored cat.” Although unrelated to the giant panda, they share a love for bamboo. Red pandas have false thumbs and retractable claws that help them climb trees and grip bamboo. They also use their tails for balance and warmth. As an umbrella species, their protection helps safeguard the forests and many other creatures that share their ecosystem.</p>

        <h2>Protecting the Fire in the Forest</h2>
        <img src="images/rp-curled.jpg" alt="Red panda in bamboo forest" class="section-img">
        <p>Today, fewer than 10,000 red pandas remain in the wild. Conservation efforts are vital to protect their forest homes and ensure future generations can continue to witness the gentle flame that is the red panda.</p>
